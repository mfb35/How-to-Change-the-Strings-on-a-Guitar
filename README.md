-New guitar strings
   > Strings come in many gauges. The gauge you choose is all personal preferance. Gauges are classified with a number. The smaller the number the thinner the strings will be and the larger the number the thicker the strings will be. The standard gauges are either 10 or 9 depending on the model of guitar.

## Steps

1. Loosen old strings and carefully remove them as fit.
    - many people use cross cut pliers after stirngs are loose
    - be carefull to not scratch the guitar if tools are used
    - throw old strings away immediately so they do not scratch the guitar

2. Apply fretboard cleaner to toothbrush and gently scrub the fretboard from one end to the other.
    - be sure to not apply fretboard cleaner directly to the guitar, this may damage it
    - this will remove sweat and oils from normal play
    
3. Use any fret polishing kit of your choice on each fret as needed.
    - make sure to only use a kit designed for guitars. This will keep the guitar safe
    - DO NOT USE POWER TOOLS
    - polished frets will make string bends eaiser
    - make sure to not overpolish. Only polish until tarnish is removed
