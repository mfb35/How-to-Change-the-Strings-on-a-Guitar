   > Strings come in many gauges. The gauge you choose is all personal preferance. Gauges are classified with a number. The smaller the number the thinner the strings will be and the larger the number the thicker the strings will be. The standard gauges are either 10 or 9 depending on the model of guitar.

## Steps

1. Loosen old strings and carefully remove them as fit.
    -many people use cross cut pliers after stirngs are loose
    -be carefull to not scratch the guitar if tools are used
    -throw old strings away immediately so they do not scratch the guitar

2. Apply fretboard cleaner to toothbrush and gently scrub the fretboard from one end to the other.
    -be sure to not apply fretboard cleaner directly to the guitar, this may damage it
    -this will remove sweat and oils from normal play
    
3. Use any fret polishing kit of your choice on each fret as needed.
